cxn_pgn v0.1 install file


    1. Make sure you have Libnet installed, packet generator was written with 1.1.2.1
       installed. Goto www.packetfactory.net or somewhere else and get it.

    2. Read the README.md file

    3. Compile via the libnet-config script (at least this is how I did it):
 
        gcc `libnet-config --cflags --defines` cxn_pgn.c -o cxn_pgn \
        `libnet-config --libs`

    4. Or for the lazy run the install.sh script
